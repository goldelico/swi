create a file called www.address-port.php (e.g. 'www.gnustep.org-80.php') 

Copy and adapt this scheme:

<?php

// database connection

$DB_HOST="mysql.somewhere.yourserver.abc";
$DB_DATABASE="gnustep";	// the database name
$DB_USER="username";
$DB_PASSWORD="database password";
$DB_TABLE="database table";

// general config

$URL="http://www.gnustep.org/softwareindex";		// URL where SWI resides
$TITLE="GNUstep Software Index";		// the TITLE

Late Xmas present by The Handheld-Linux Shop to the Zaurus Community

New Software Index to revitalize Killefiz

Dear all,

as you know the www.Killefiz.de/zaurus database is still running but no longer maintained since October. But the latest information and its raw data can be downloaded.

Therefore, we have written a new front-end for a Killefiz-like database and added some features, so that we hope that it gets revitalized and gains again better adoption.

We have
* used the original page layout because we find that it is clean, neat and not overloaded with unneccessary information
* added an RSS feed
* added a mechanism for multiple managers/moderators (so that it not again becomes the burden of a single person)
* added a login-mechanism to allow
  - to subscribe to packages (i.e. e-mail notifications for updates)
  - for multiple management accounts (where you can help to approve/reject change requests)
  - to add comments (not yet finished)

Unfortunately, we do not have the list of pending change requests, so the backlog of Killefiz is not included. And, we have not found a way to import the raw ELSIX database - so there will unfortunately be some outdated information. If you know how to get that data, we could try to work it in.

So, please use the Software Index, search it, submit new applications and change requests, apply for becoming a manager, make the link known to everybody, report bugs and make suggestions for improvement, etc.

And finally, this is a free service to anybody and is not thought to be a replacement of ELSIX.

Here you can find it: http://www.handheld-linux.com/swi/index.php
